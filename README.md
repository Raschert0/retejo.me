# astimeline
a complete timeline (and API) of apostolic succession, from the original apostles to now

note: this timeline is aligned for the Episcopal and Anglican churches, this list ignores all Orthodox and Catholic bishops past the Church of England breaking away. if you feel like forking this to add Catholic/Orthodox bishops, have at it
